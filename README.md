# Preamble
This repository contains the lecture slides and course description for the Natural Language Processing course offered in 2017/2018 2nd term at the Telkom University. 

This is an introductory course on natural language processing. The NLP topic deals with the interaction between human and computer, and the ultimate goal is that computer could understand the command delivered in human natural language. The biggest challenge in processing natural language is ambiguity. Ambiguity found in each level of language complexity, from the lexical until pragmatic level. This course objective includes the student ability to design and evaluate a system that is based on lexical, syntactic, and semantic level of language processing, and to design - implement - evaluate an NLP based system for a real problem.

# Lecture Materials
## 1. Lecture 1 - Introduction
This lecture introduces the course and motivates why it is interesting to study language processing.

[[slides]](course/01_Lecture_Intro.pdf)

### Weekly Assignments
Python and NLTK introduction.
[[description]](course/PythonIntroduction_NLP.pdf) Please do the exercise and answer the questions on no. 6 and 7!

## 2. Lecture 2 - Language Modeling
This lecture introduces the concept of Language Modeling (LM), the definition and the computation of LM probability component (unigram, bigram, likelihood), LM development process, and LM evaluation.

I used slide from Jurafsky and Manning NLP course, which can be found in https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/NLPCourseraSlides.html

### Weekly Assignments
Building simple Language Model and the application: Poetry Generator.
